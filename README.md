## Metrics
<table> <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr> <tr><td>Total Sales</td><td>$9.6M</td><td>Overall revenue scale</td></tr> <tr><td>Net Profit</td><td>$3.83M</td><td>True business value after costs</td></tr> <tr><td>Unique Orders</td><td>326</td><td>Order volume indicator</td></tr> <tr><td>Avg Order Value</td><td>$29.46K</td><td>Revenue efficiency per order</td></tr> </table>

## Findings
1. Profit Is Highly Concentrated in a Single Product Line
- Classic Cars generate the largest share of net profit by a wide margin.
- Several product lines contribute meaningfully less, suggesting portfolio imbalance.
- Low-performing lines increase complexity without proportional return.

2. Cost of Sales Scales Predictably With Profit
- Strong linear relationship between cost of sales and net profit.
- Indicates stable pricing and cost discipline, with limited margin volatility.
- Opportunity exists to optimize margins further at higher sales volumes.

3. Regional Performance Is Uneven
- A small number of countries and offices contribute the majority of profit.
- Long-tail regions add marginal profit while increasing operational overhead.
- Clear candidates exist for regional focus vs. maintenance mode.

4. Revenue Growth Is Driven by Order Value, Not Order Count
- Order volume remains relatively stable.
- Revenue growth is primarily driven by higher-value transactions, not more orders.
- Reinforces importance of key accounts and premium product lines.

## Business Recommendations
### Product Strategy
Prioritize Classic Cars in marketing, inventory planning, and sales incentives.
Reassess underperforming product lines for margin improvement or rationalization.

### Regional Sales Strategy
- Allocate senior sales resources to top-performing countries and offices.
- Limit aggressive expansion in low-contribution regions unless margins improve.

### Pricing & Margin Management
- Monitor cost-of-sales trends closely as volume scales.
- Introduce margin-based KPIs alongside revenue targets.

### Customer Focus
- Segment customers by profit contribution, not just sales.
- Protect and grow high-value accounts driving large average order sizes.
